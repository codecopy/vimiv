The most important changes between versions are listed here.

#### v0.9.1
* Remove dependency "pillow" in setup.py (thanks Anthraxx for pointing this out)

#### v0.9
* Async loading of images and gifs
* Overzoom setting is now float instead of bool
* Improve handling of animated gifs:
  * Allow scaling
  * Add autoplay\_gifs option
* Rewrite the generation of the dictionary used for storing internal commands
* Also read configuration files from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vimiv/
* Implement the freedesktop standard for thumbnail management (thanks woefe),
  this leads to these changes:
  * Remove the settings cache_thumbnails, thumbsize and thumb_maxsize
  * New default_thumbsize setting
  * Remove the clear_thumbs command
* Thumbnail generation and scaling is now asynchronous (thanks woefe) 
* Move data (history, logfile and tags) to $XDG_DATA_HOME/vimiv/
* Implement freedesktop's trash specification, this leads to these changes:
  * Default trash directory is now $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash
  * Remove the clear_trash command as this may delete far more than only
    vimiv's trash. If anyone has hard feelings about this, it is very easy to
    bind to an alias.
  * Add an :undelete command to move images back to their original path.
* Large code changes to decouple vimiv
* New way to handle settings:
  * Settings are now stored in one global class for increased flexibility
  * Rewrite of the :set command which now simply changes a setting in the
    storage
  * Changed setting names to reflect new behaviour:
    * autoplay\_gifs renamed to play\_animations
    * show\_library renamed to start\_show\_library
  * The set brightness/contrast/sharpness commands are now called edit
    brightness/contrast/sharpness.
  * All commands that started with set are now merged into a single set command
    leading to different command names for some of them.
* Get rid of PIL as dependency:
  * GdkPixbuf used for all simple transformations
  * A small C-extension deals with brightness and contrast
  * Support for editing sharpness was dropped
  * Editing saturation is now possible
  * New optional dependency `gexiv2` for Exif support
* New autosave\_images setting
* New :w and :wq commands
* Add appdata file (thanks Ankur Sinha!)

#### v0.8
* Rewrite large parts to make vimiv a Gtk.Application
* Rewrite parser as Gtk parser
* Rewrite open using the Gtk.Application do_open method
* Add command copy to clipboard which copies the currently selected
  image name to clipboard or primary depending on the copy_to_primary
  setting. The selection can be toggled using the set clipboard!
  command.
* Default flip keybindings to | and _ because y and Y are used for the copy
  method
* Implement --temp-basedir flag
* Rewrite command line completion with a Gtk.TreeView This allows the usage of
  native Gtk filtering and showing some information on internal commands.
  Downside: no more completion for external commands as the Gtk.ListStore model
  involved is not performant enough for large amounts of data.
* Rename and merge commands:
  * zoom_thumb_in/\_out merged into zoom_in/\_out
  * cmd_history\_\* renamed to history\_\*
  * left/down/up/right merged into scroll hjkl
  * bri\_/con\_/sha\_focus merged into focus_slider bri/con/sha
  * slideshow\_inc/\_dec merged into slideshow_delay value
* Allow setting text upon command line entry via command text.
* Improve messages from the statusbar. They now come in three flavours: error,
  warning and info and set a different color indicater for each one.
* Introduce tilde_in_statusbar setting to collapse $HOME to ~ in the library
  statusbar.
* Introduce clear_status command to remove any numbers or messages from the
  statusbar and reset search.
* Create thumbnails directly with Gdk.Pixbuf.new_from_file_at_scale
* Only edit image file when leaving image after calling rotate/flip
* Make thumbnail padding configurable
* Add a simple log file written to basedir/vimiv.log
* --debug flag now writes useful information to the log file.
* Allow passing count for more functions and clear count if the function does
  not support it
* Implement simple mouse support
* Deprecate combined keybinding sections like IM_LIB, GENERAL, ...
