Vimiv is configured via two files:

* the <b class="filename">vimivrc</b> for basic configuration
* the <b class="filename">keys.conf</b> for keybindings

Per default these files are installed to /etc/vimiv/. It is considered best
practice to copy them to $XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/vimiv/ and configure the copied files.
